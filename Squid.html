<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<h3>Squid</h3>

<ul>

    <li>½ a bunch of fresh mint , (15g)</li>
    <li>4 spring onions</li>
    <li>8 medium whole squid , (500g), gutted, cleaned, from sustainable sources</li>
    <li>vegetable oil , for frying</li>
    <li>white pepper</li>
    <li>100 g plain flour</li>
    <li>1 small handful of fresh mixed-colour chillies</li>
    <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white or red wine vinegar</li>

</ul>



<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    
<li>Pick the mint leaves into a small bowl of cold water to ensure they stay super-fresh.</li>
<li>Trim the spring onions and halve across the middle, then finely slice lengthways and add to the water bowl.</li>
<li>Pat the squid dry with kitchen paper, then use a regular eating knife to lightly score the inside of the squid at ½cm intervals at an angle. Turn the squid through 90° and do the same again to create a criss-cross pattern.</li>
<li>When you’re ready to cook, just under half fill a large sturdy pan with oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go.</li>
<li>While it heats, tip 1 heaped tablespoon of white pepper and the flour into a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt. Add the squid, toss and mix together to coat, then leave in the flour for a few minutes while you prick the chillies – if some are bigger, halve and deseed them first – then peel and finely slice the garlic 1mm thick, ideally on a mandolin (use the guard!).</li>
<li>When you’re ready to fry, add half the squid and chillies – it’s important to cook in two batches so you don’t overcrowd the pan. When it’s all looking golden and lovely (after about 1½ minutes), add half the garlic for a final minute.</li>
<li>Use a slotted spoon to scoop everything into a bowl or pan lined with kitchen paper to drain while you cook the second batch.</li>
<li>Whip out the paper, then cut the squid into bite-sized pieces and return to the bowl. Drizzle with the vinegar, add a good pinch of seasoning, the drained mint leaves and spring onion curls, toss it all together and serve right away.</li>
<li>ENJOY!</li>
